## Deep Learning Day

We had great fun organizing the first [deep learning day](https://sites.google.com/site/sdsdlday2016/) and are pleased to anounce a second run on 09/22/2017. We would like to have an **active participation** and encourage you to send in an abstract for a poster or talk by 1st of August 2017. Note that the **number of participants will be limited to 60** persons, so poster presenters have a much greater chance to take part at the workshop.
